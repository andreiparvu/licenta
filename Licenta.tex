\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we propose an algorithm for detecting similar images in a large scale dataset.
After considering various methods as invisible watermarking and image feature detection, we 
developed a method based on the $Harris\ corner\ detection$ and the $Scale\ Invariant\ Feature\ Transform$ keypoints and descriptors for analyzing the properties of an image.\\
Our goal is that the proposed algorithm be resilient to watermarked, scaled or cropped images, 
and provide a fast running time for our large dataset.\\
In order to be able to handle a large amount of images and associated data, we have decided to maintain the descriptors of the images in a set of KD-tree structures for fast querying.
This allows an initial filtering of the data set, reducing the number of images which should be analyzed.
Thus, we will use two algorithms, one of which has a lower time complexity, but only gives semi-accurate results, and a second one, which performed a more in-depth analysis of the images.\\
We will describe the mathematical aspects of the two mentioned algorithms, and the adjustments made to the algorithms in order to perform better on our given problem.\\
The architecture of the application also important, because it highly influences the distribution of data, and how the algorithm performs on a large data set, with a high number of queries and possible updates on the initial image set.
We will detail this architecture and the way the data should be distributed so that an efficient use of multiple machines can speed up the algorithm.\\
