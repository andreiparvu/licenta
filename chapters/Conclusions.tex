\chapter{Conclusions}

In this paper I have designed a scalable algorithm that is capable of detecting a highly similar images in a large database.\\
I have succeeded in obtaining a small response time for querying the database in finding a highly similar image with a given one, maintaining at the same time a good quality of the responses.

\section {Further Work}
	This algorithm can be further extended for handling a dynamic database, in which operations as adding and removing an image can be present along with the query operations previously described.\\
	Also, the structure and size of the KD-tree data structure can be further analyzed, in order to determine the moment in which new data should be used to create a new KD-tree. \\
	The management and distribution of the queries between the FEP and the image server should be considered as a possible improvement, possibly establishing several filtering layers instead of a single one (as described in \nameref{chap:implementation}).
